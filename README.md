# Maze Solver(ACCEPTS FIRST 5 PR'S DURING BOOST)
This is a maze solver application written in C++. 

## Why?
Cos opencv in python seemed too easy.

## Tech stack
* C++
* opencv

## How to run
1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (NOT TURBO C++). If you're new to this, an IDE like visual studio would do. 
2. Make sure you have opencv installed. 
	(Since the project was made in Visual Studio, following this [tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/install-and-configure-opencv-4-2-0-in-windows-10-vc-d132c52063a1) should help)
3. Compile and run.

## Is this beginner friendly?
Probably not. Difficulty = **medium**

But if you are comfortable with matrices and path finding algorithms, definitely give it a try!

## What if I have a problem?
The first step is to always google stuff. Try different searches and keywords, look through stackoverflow.

If that doesn't help, contact any maintainer or ACM PESUECC team member!
